        Each row is loss due to one
        datapoint. The first three columns are the 2D data \(x_i\) and the label \(y_i\).
        The next three columns are the three class scores from each classifier
        \(f(x_i;W,b)=Wx_i+b\) (E.g. s[0] = x[0] * W[0,0] + x[1] * W[0,1] + b[0]). The
        last column is the data loss for a single example, \(L_i\).
